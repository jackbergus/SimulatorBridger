# IoTSim-Osmosis-RES

IoTSim-Osmosis-RES is a simulation framework that supports the testing and validation of osmotic computing applications with support of renewable energy sources.

It is based on the IoTSim-Osmosis framework and extended by renewable energy modules and the osmotic agent mechanisms enabling research on renewable energy-aware autonomic IoT systems.

# Main Features

There are a few primary sources of green energy as solar, wind, water. However, in the framework, the focus is on solar energy with the future possibility of extensions to others energy sources.

Support for Osmotic Agents which are assigned to IoT devices as well as edge and cloud datacenters. Agents implement the autonomic computing MAPE loop - Monitor, Analyze, Plan and Execute. Interface-based architecture facilitates the end-user to implement logic for the agents. The Osmotic Agents can constitute the distributed multi agent environment in which they can cooperate by exchanging messages.
